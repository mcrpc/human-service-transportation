# Introduction

This draft document presents findings from the analysis of recently released ACS data for the HSTP update. All maps are saved in the /map subfolder of this repository.

# Population Characteristics

NOTE: Tracts with more than 50% urban population in the 2010 census are excluded.

## General

This section covers general characteristics of the population in the rural areas of Region 6.

### Population Density

Mostly low density areas with a few small urban centers.

```{r population density map}
Region6TractPopulationDensityMap
```
```{r total population graph}
Region6TotalPopulationTimeSeriesGraph
```

```{r total population table}
Region6TotalPopulationTimeSeriesTable
```

## Age Groups

This section breaks down the population by age groups.

### Under 18

Calculated using detailed table B01001, "SEX BY AGE".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_blw18))`.

Areas of McLean and Livingston counties have very high numbers of minors as proportion of the population.

```{r percent below 18 map}
Region6TractPercentBelow18Map
```

### Between 18 and 65

Calculated using detailed table B01001, "SEX BY AGE".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_18to65))`.

```{r percent 18 to 65 map}
Region6TractPercent18to65Map
```

### Over 65

Calculated using detailed table B01001, "SEX BY AGE".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_ovr65))`.

Significant correlation between lower population density and higher population over 65 among rural Illinois tracts. This seems to hold in Region 6, where 20% or more of the population is over 65 in `r length(with(tractLayer, which(per_ovr65 > .2)))` of `r length(tractLayer)` tracts.

```{r percent over 65 map}
Region6TractPercentOver65Map
```

## Disability

### Percent of adults with any disability

Calculated using detailed table B18101, "SEX BY AGE BY DISABILITY STATUS".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_dsblty))`.

Percent of population with a disability is correlated to poverty rate in Illinois tracts.

```{r disability map}
Region6TractPercentDisabilityMap
```

## Veterans

### Veterans as percent of all adults

Calculated using detailed table B21001, "SEX BY AGE BY VETERAN STATUS FOR THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 18 YEARS AND OVER".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_vet))`.

Rural areas of Livingston and Iroquois counties have proportionally high numbers of Veterans, and are somewhat far removed from the VA facilities in Kankakee and Bloomington.

```{r veterans map}
Region6TractPercentVeteranMap
```

```{r veterans graph}
Region6TotalVeteranTimeSeriesGraph
```

```{r veterans table}
Region6TotalVeteranTimeSeriesTable
```

The number of veterans in the rural areas of the Region 6 counties would appear to be declining faster than the overall population. However, only in Rural Kankakee and Rural McLean does the decline between the 2014 and 2018 estimates exceed the margin of error.

```{r veterans dot density}
Region6BlockGroupVeteranDotDensityMap
```

The above dot density map should be taken with the usual caveats that come with ACS estimates, especially ones aggregated at the block group level.

### Veterans Over 55

```{r veterans over 55 graph}

```{r veterans over 55 table}

```

## Poverty

### Poverty Rate

Calculated using detailed table B17020, "POVERTY STATUS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS BY AGE".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_blwpov))`.

Poverty is somewhat correlated with population density in rural Illinois tracts. In Region 6, poverty appears to be concentrated around the small urban centers, also Hopkins Park in Kankakee, historically an economically depressed area.

```{r poverty rate map}
Region6TractPercentBelowPovertyMap
```

### Households with elderly members on SNAP

Calculated using detailed table B22001, "RECEIPT OF FOOD STAMPS/SNAP IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS BY PRESENCE OF PEOPLE 60 YEARS AND OVER FOR HOUSEHOLDS".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_hhSo60))`.

Concentrated in Hopkins Park, Kankakee and parts of Pontiac.

```{r households on SNAP with persons over 60 map}
Region6TractPercentHouseholdSNAPOver60Map
```

## Income

### Median Household Income

Calculated using detailed table B22008, "MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2018 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) BY RECEIPT OF FOOD STAMPS/SNAP IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$inc_medhh))`.


```{r median household income map}
Region6TractMedianHouseholdIncomeMap
```

### Income Per Capita

Calculated using detailed table B19301, "PER CAPITA INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2018 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS)".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$inc_percap))`.

Similar distribution to median household income

Region6TractIncomePerCapitaMap
```

```{r per capita income graph}
Region6IncomePerCapitaTimeSeriesGraph
```

```{r per capita income table}
Region6IncomePerCapitaTimeSeriesTable
```

### GINI

Calculated using detailed table B19083, "GINI INDEX OF INCOME INEQUALITY".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$gini))`.

Possible relationship to poverty

```{r gini coefficient map}
Region6TractGINICoefficientMap
```

## Transportation

### Percent of Households with No Vehicle Available

Calculated using detailed table B08141, "MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION TO WORK BY VEHICLES AVAILABLE".

The average value for Illinois counties in `r acsYear` was `r percent(mean(illinoisCountyData$per_nocars))`.

Eastern Kankakee County, Pontiac in Livingston County, and Le Roy in McLean County stand out.

# SHOWBUS

From the 2015 HSTP Plan:

>SHOW BUS has been providing public rural transportation in central Illinois since 1979.
Services are available to all residents of rural DeWitt, Ford, Iroquois, Kankakee,
Livingston, Macon and McLean Counties. The agency provides limited stop service and
door-to-door service. For door-to-door service, the schedule has a general geographic
area indicated. Rides for any purpose are available. The agency also provides limited
Special Service Routes. SHOW BUS also assists in providing non-emergency medical
transportation including emergency room and hospital discharge or medical
appointments. Service contracts and voucher programs are also available through
SHOW BUS.

The nature of SHOW BUS' operations and lack of data collection limit our ability to analyze their service. Many of the connections displayed in the map below occur once or twice a week, and several occur only on alternating weeks.
